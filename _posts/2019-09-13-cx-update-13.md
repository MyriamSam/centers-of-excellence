<h3>Background</h3>
USDA, like all federal agencies, must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in considering the environmental impact of its proposed projects. Public engagement is a vital part of that process. However, when it comes to the National Forests, each one is left to determine for itself the details of how and when it engages the public. 

The challenges of public engagement can be great, but the costs of not doing it properly are even greater: When public stakeholders (including industry, advocacy groups, and individuals) don’t feel genuinely engaged in the process, or feel that their input hasn’t been taken into account, they’re far more likely to pursue litigation that can impose great costs, in both money and effort, on the Forest Service.

The Forest Service reached out to the Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE) to find ways it could improve its environmental analysis and decision-making (EADM) and identify ways to make the public commenting and policymaking process, easier, more effective, and more transparent for people. 

<h3>The Process</h3>
Our team started by partnering with the USDA Forest Service Washington Office Ecosystem Management Coordination (EMC) group to scope out the project.

Our original research plan included visits to three different National Forests of different sizes, regions, and public engagement strategies (particularly looking at Forests where public engagement was going well, and some where it wasn’t). In addition, we wanted to look at how Forests used digital platforms and social media in their engagement strategies, with the overall goal of giving the Forest Service a baseline for what public engagement should look like throughout the National Forest system.

Due to external factors, our original research scope was reduced to one research visit. We were fortunate that it was an ideal case study candidate: Payette National Forest [https://www.fs.usda.gov/payette/], a 2.3-million-acre forest in rural Idaho with a top-tier public engagement strategy, an actively engaged Forest Supervisor, and a lively and passionate Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project (CFLRP) group, the Payette Forest Coalition (PFC) [http://www.payetteforestcoalition.org/] (composed of civilians, community-based organizations, and business owners).

<h3>Field Research</h3>
Our research team, comprising CX CoE researchers and Forest Service staff, headed out to McCall, Idaho to speak with Forest Service staff, members of PFC and other community organizations, and local residents randomly selected for “intercept interviews” (short interviews with people on the street and in local businesses).

In addition to one-on-one interviews, the team also conducted surveys, held focus group sessions, and sat in on community-organized and Forest Service staff meetings.  (You can see more about the team’s methodology in the Payette Findings Report.)

Using human-centered design (HCD) methods, the team collected 231 qualitative data points (interview quotes and field observations); through our synthesis process, we grouped them into 21 themes, and turned those themes into six insights, leading ultimately to three opportunity areas for further exploration and solution development:

<h3>Findings: Insights and Opportunity Areas</h3>
The team found that, even at a National Forest with good public engagement, there were plenty of ways they could improve:

* Generally speaking, they needed to do a better job of increasing the general public’s understanding of how the complex (even arcane) NEPA process works; how to understand the impact of very large or very small-scale projects; and how to give feedback that will be truly useful for the Forest Service. 
* They also needed to find ways to include members of the public—especially those with differing perspectives and levels of expertise, or ones who can’t make it to hours-long meetings regularly held during normal business hours.
* Most importantly, Forest Service, needed to make public engagement an organizational priority, and give staff improved guidance, more resources, and better tools to do it.

<h3>Social Listening & Digital Platforms</h3>
In addition to the field research in Idaho, the team examined Forest Service social media and websites, to understand how the public used those platforms to get and spread information. In our social listening analysis, we looked at social media conversations about Forest Service on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Based on the research, we made recommendations on how Forest Service could optimize its social media presences to support public outreach and engagement. We even created some prototype web pages showing examples of how Forest Service could redesign its web pages to  highlight information that its customers are looking for.

<h3>Results</h3>
You can see more details on our research and findings (including quotes from research participants) in the Payette Findings Report [Link TK], which the CX CoE delivered to Forest Service, along with all of our other research materials, so that they can continue to build on our work. Ultimately, we hope that our model for improving public engagement in National Forests will increase public satisfaction, reduce litigation, and create a model that can be applied to the rest of USDA and federal agency policymaking, so we can improve transparency and trust in government.
