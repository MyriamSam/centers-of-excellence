<h3>Background</h3>

USDA, like all federal agencies, must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in considering the environmental impact of its proposed projects. Public engagement is a vital part of that process. However, when it comes to the National Forests, each one is left to determine for itself the details of how and when it engages the public. 

The challenges of public engagement can be great, but the costs of not doing it properly are even greater: When public stakeholders (including industry, advocacy groups, and individuals) don’t feel genuinely engaged in the process, or feel that their input hasn’t been taken into account, they’re far more likely to pursue litigation that can impose great costs, in both money and effort, on the Forest Service.

The Forest Service reached out to the Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE) to find ways it could improve its environmental analysis and decision-making (EADM) and identify ways to make the public commenting and policymaking process, easier, more effective, and more transparent for people. 


<h3>The Process</h3>

Our team started by partnering with the USDA Forest Service Washington Office Ecosystem Management Coordination (EMC) group to scope out the project.

CX CoE meets with Forest Service; using a worksheet to determine project scope; capturing insights using live graphic facilitation. 

Our original research plan included visits to three different National Forests of different sizes, regions, and public engagement strategies (particularly looking at Forests where public engagement was going well, and some where it wasn’t). In addition, we wanted to look at how Forests used digital platforms and social media in their engagement strategies, with the overall goal of giving the Forest Service a baseline for what public engagement should look like throughout the National Forest system.

Due to external factors, our original research scope was reduced to one research visit. We were fortunate that it was an ideal case study candidate: Payette National Forest [https://www.fs.usda.gov/payette/], a 2.3-million-acre forest in rural Idaho with a top-tier public engagement strategy, an actively engaged Forest Supervisor, and a lively and passionate Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project (CFLRP) group, the Payette Forest Coalition (PFC) [http://www.payetteforestcoalition.org/] (composed of civilians, community-based organizations, and business owners).

<h3>Field Research</h3>
In a close, collaborative partnership with FSA, we developed, tested, and launched the **Farm Loan Discovery Tool**, now online on <a href="https://www.farmers.gov/fund">farmers.gov/fund</a>. The tool walks potential loan applicants through a few simple questions to help direct them to FSA loans that could match their situation: Direct Operating and Ownership Loans for Individuals and Entities, Youth Loans, and Microloans:

**(Above)** Example questions and results from the Farm Loans Discovery Tool.

The Farm Loan Discovery Tool also gives users the relevant printable **Application Quick Guides**, where they get a high-level overview of what they can expect—and what’s expected of them—through the loan application process. The Application Quick Guides also stand on their own, as printable guides (each eight pages or less) that loan officers can use as informational handouts at outreach events.

**(Above)** The four USDA Farm Loans Application Quick Guides for Individuals and Entities, Youth Loans, and Microloans: short, printable PDFs to help prepare producers for their farm loan journey.

The goal of both the Farm Loan Discovery Tool and the Application Quick Guides is to make producers better prepared and more comfortable for their first meeting with an FSA loan officer, who remains an irreplaceable partner in producers’ success. 

<h3>What’s Next</h3>
As we evaluate how the Farm Loan Discovery Tool and Application Quick Guides perform in the field (with real producers and loan staff), we’re hopeful that USDA can expand this discovery, development, and testing model in the future to include other types of USDA loans and grants, and eventually serve as a template for improving all of USDA’s applicant experiences
